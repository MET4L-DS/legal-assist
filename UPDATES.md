NEXT STEP — Frontend Polish (Low risk, high value)

Your frontend is already good. Now make it feel authoritative.

1. Timeline UX (small tweaks)

Keep Critical Actions (You) always visible on mobile

Make Procedural Steps (Police/Court) collapsible

Add tooltip:

“Procedural steps are handled by authorities, not actions required from you.”

This prevents user anxiety.

2. Confidence & Notice UI

When backend sends:

confidence: "low"
system_notice: { ... }

Frontend should:

Show a yellow warning banner

Never hide timelines, just contextualize them

This matches your backend safety philosophy.
